# Nonospace

Nonospace is a project intended primarily as an exercise in exploring the
modern JS-based web ecosystem. It is by no means an extensive exploration, as
that would be impossible with the pace of changes in web technologies.

The plan (for now):

- ~~Make a nonogram class to handle the state of the puzzle~~
- ~~Make frontend components with React to render the said state~~
- ~~Use the flux paradigm to connect state and UI~~
- Build a nonogram server that serves random puzzles for a start
- Extend the server to connect to a database and pull puzzles from there
- Figure out how to automate Google Cloud Platform deployment
- Set up the deployment with load balancers to be able to scale out


In the end, I intend to host a copy of this somewhere for people to interact with
(because what use are games if nobody plays them).

Collaborations are not accepted at this time, because this is a personal
practice project. If you have suggestions about it, you can open an issue and I
promise I will read it :)
